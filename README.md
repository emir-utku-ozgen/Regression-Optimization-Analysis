# Regression & Optimization Algorithm Analysis 🚀

This project focuses on analyzing the performance and weight convergence trajectories ($w$) of various optimization algorithms on high-dimensional NLP data.

## 📝 Project Overview
A binary classification regression model was trained using synthetic text data generated by LLMs. The primary objective is to compare the efficiency and behavior of optimization algorithms within the loss landscape.

### 🛠 Technical Architecture
- **Data Generation:** 200 synthetic QA pairs generated via `Turkish-Gemma-9b-T1`.
- **Vector Representation:** 768-dimensional semantic embeddings generated using the `turkish-e5-large` model.
- **Model Function:** $y = \tanh(w \cdot x)$
- **Analysis Method:** 2D projection of high-dimensional weight updates ($w_{1:t}$) using T-SNE.

## 📊 Comparison of Optimization Algorithms
The following algorithms were tested using 5 different random initial weights ($w_0$):

* **Gradient Descent (GD):** Deterministic updates performed over the entire dataset.
* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** Fast but noisy gradient updates.
* **Adam Optimizer:** Dynamic convergence using momentum and adaptive learning rates.

### 📉 Visualization & Results (T-SNE)
The optimization paths taken by each algorithm are reduced to 2 dimensions using the T-SNE algorithm and presented as trajectories in the weight space:
